# Recommendations with IBM Project

### Motivation
In this project, I build a user-article recommendation engine using real data from the IBM Watson Studio platform.

The corresponding Jupyter notebook is organized as follows:
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Rank Based Recommendations
* User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
* Matrix Factorization
* Conclusion

### Installation Instructions:
1. Clone the project from my Github: https://github.com/yuhuang3/machine-learning/tree/master/Udacity/project3

2. Uncompress dataset files such as csv files, Python pickle files, etc.

3. Run the Jupyter notebook

### Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Udacity for its excellent data scientist training program and my mentor for the project review.
