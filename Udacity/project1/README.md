### Project 1: Stack Overflow Data - Trends over Time from 2017 to 2020 Surveys 
In this project I use the StackOverflow survey data from 2017 to 2020 to analyze the following trends over time. 

* What languages were most popular in each year?
* What databases were most popular in each year?
* What countries were most popular in each year?

#### Libraries
* Python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

#### Files 
* Jupyter notebook: data_science_blog_post.ipynb
* The surveys csv files under ./data (NOTE: the dataset csv files are not uploaded due to Github size limit)

#### Summary
* The results of trend analysis show that Python becomes more and more polular over time, while the popularity of Java decreases over time. The possible reason is that data science and machine learning are more and more popular, and Python is the most common programming language in use. 
* The results of trend analysis show that PostgreSql becomes more and more polular over time, while the popularity of Oracle decreases over time. The possible reason is that open source becomes more and more popular and PostgreSql is one of the open source databases. 
* The results of trend analysis show that the top 10 countries remain the same from 2017 to 2020.
