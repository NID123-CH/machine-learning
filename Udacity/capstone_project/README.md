# Data Scientist Capstone: Healthcare 
## Predicting Hospitalized Time of Covid-19 Patients

### Motivation
The outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 caused tremendous equipment, materials deficiency and beds shortage problems in healthcare system across the U.S. The hospitals not only need to take care of the routine patients, but also need to take care of the sudden increased Covid-19 patients. A good planning and management of a hospital system become very important. 

This project is to use machine-learning techniques to predict how long (how many days) a Covid-19 patient needs to stay in a hospital at the time of admission. This will help hospital professionals to make an optimized planning for patient treatment and resources (e.g., room, bed, etc.) allocation. This also could reduce the amount of hospital visitors to decrease the chance of staff and visitor infection.

### Installation Instructions:
1. Clone the project from my [Github](https://github.com/yuhuang3/machine-learning/tree/master/Udacity/capstone_project)
2. Install mlflow and other libraries (see the imports in the notebook)
3. Run the Jupyter notebook

### Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Udacity for its excellent data scientist training program, the project review, and Kaggle for the Covid-19 dataset.
